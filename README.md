# js_coding_challenges

Write a JavaScript function that takes a string as an input and returns the reverse of that string.
Modify the function to handle special characters or whitespace gracefully. 

Write a version of the function that doesn't use the split, reverse, or join methods. 

Create a web page that allows users to input a string and see the reversed result interactively.
